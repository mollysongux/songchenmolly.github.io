#User Testing (Moderatored)

##Definition

User Testing is a techqnique to evaluate a product by testing it on users. It focuses on measuring a human-made product's capacity (use tasks) to meet its intended.

The moderator/Facilitator is also a factor in defining user-testing. 

* A moderator or facilitators are there to facilitate the test and observe behavior, not help the participant complete tasks. There are two basic models:
	* **Facilitator interacts with the participant** - you often get more qualitative information, especially when the facilitator is good at asking neutral questions and encouraging participants to find their own answers in the product.
	* **Facilitator does not interact with the participant** you can get more natural behavior, but participants are left to struggle or quit on their own. You often will not get as much qualitative data as participants may not talk out loud as much. You may get more accurate measures of time on task and failure, however. 

If we conduct usability test in UX room or via skype or google hangout, having a moderator with real user, it will collect qualitative information as well as the quantitative information. You will know the thought behind user's thinking about the task.

Depending on the feedbacks you needed, you might need multiple tasks in the user testing. Right now, we could conduct click task, 5 second test, preference task, and cart sorting task.

[**Click task**](3-click-task.md)

Click task is used to discover if a user can complete a task by analyzing their click or tap behavior. The name of click task has lots of variations depending on the location where the click test performs and design stage when the click test conducts. 

[**5 second task**](3-5s.md)

5 second task measures what information users will take away and what impression they will get within the first five seconds of viewing a design. They're commonly used to test whether web pages are effectively communicating their intended message.

[**Preference task**](3-preference-task.md)

Preference task can help you to choose between design variations, by simply asking users which one they prefer. When taking part in a preference test, a participant is shown a number of design options and is asked to pick a favorite. Be care of variations in one preference test must be present at the same time. 

[**Card Sort task**](3-card-sort.md)

Card Sorting task is a method used to help design or evaluate the information architecture of a site. In a card sorting session, participants organize topics into categories that make sense to them and they may also help you label these groups.


##When To Use

For user testing with moderator, we could collect user's thinking behind the bahavioral data, attitude data, and information archeture data. The cons are it will be expensive and time-consuming to conduct moderated user-testing.
