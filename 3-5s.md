#5 Second task

##Definition

Preference task can help you to choose between design variations, by simply asking users which one they prefer. When taking part in a preference test, a participant is shown a number of design options and is asked to pick a favorite. Be care of variations in one preference test must be present at the same time. 


##When To Use

**Preference Task** 

	You must show the two editions at the same time, which is different from A/B test

	Which order icon is more liked by user?


##How To Use

Once you decide the question you want to ask and the task type, go to the "Mouser.com Usability Test Program" folder, and click your task package where you can find usability checklist templates to follow directly or you can customize them by editing InDesign files. 

![Overview of the files](utoverview.png)

You can see that each task has two checklists pdfs: UX Room and Remote Checklist. UX Room checklist documents the test procedures in UX Room. The remote checklist records the online test procedure. You might need to take test cost and time factors into consideration when choosing the testing location.

The general process with a moderator includes the recruit subjects (only for UX Room test), test plan, the procedure, and test report. The checklist will instruct you how to operate the test. So, the first thing you will need to do is to duplicate and save one copy of the checklist before starting.

Here is an example of the checklists.

	Specific Step 2: Test Procedure (preference task, 5 second task, click task, and card sort task)
	Common Step 3: Test Report Overview
	
###Step 1: Test Plan

**Test Plan Overview**

Document your test plan with a "protocol". We have made a checklist to help you track all the details. Scenario and task design are one of the mot important factors to conside. Plan to have participants accomplish typical tasks with the product under controlled conditions. The tasks should provide the data than answers your design qustions. 

* Consider the Where, When, and How
Test plan overview is the common part of all the tests. You will need to duplicate and complete the test plan sheet before the test. There are three standard sections, "Business Case", "Feature", and "Target Users", which should be filled out on all the test plan sheet.

![Test Plan Overview Example](testplan.png)

>**Business Case** refers to the project background. Try to use 1 or 2 sentences to explain "Why we need to design this product?", "What benefits will it bring if we do this?", and "What is the risk if we do not do this?"; Can you show me how would you buy many products? 

>**Feature** is the product feature you will test. The feature's location should be indicated.

>**Targeted User** section is where you put targeted user assumptions, based on the result of design studio.

>**Scenario** is supposed to be same in all the preference tasks and five second tasks (the preference task scenario is to choose which prototype you like; the five second task is to describe your feelings about the prototype). For clicks test, please fill out  the tasks you want the user to do. 

Tips for Writing Scenarios

>You may find it easiest to write tasks first, then scenarios, or vice versa. In our examples, we start with writing a scenario.
Imagine why your users would want to use your product in general, then specifically what would motivate them to encounter the design elements you are evaluating. Scenarios should be a story that provides motivation to your participants.

>Effective tasks often contain scenario information, which give the test participant an understanding of their motivation and context for accomplishing the task and all information needed to complete the task. A scenario could be given to participants before beginning the tasks. For example, to find out how users use the store on your Web site, a scenario could state, 'You have been researching different types of video cameras to buy to record family videos and transfer them on to your computer. You want to use the Web site to find information about video cameras and purchase a camera based on your needs.'

>Another method is to fold scenario information into each task.
For example, a task might state, 'Purchase a video camera,' but a task with scenario information would give more detail: 'You want to purchase a video camera that is small and lightweight, and can transfer video files on to your computer. You have a budget of $400. Find and purchase a camera that meets your needs.'

>Scenario Do's and Don'ts: Create a believable scenario and Don't create long, complex scenarios - consider breaking them up into smaller scenarios for smaller groups of tasks. 


###Step 2: UX Room Test/Remote Test

There are five phases in the UX Room Test and we will follow the checklists to conduct the test.

	Pilot Study
	Phase 1 Prior to testing
	Phase 2 Prior to each participant
	Phase 3 Prior to each task
	Phase 4 After each participant
	Phase 5 After all testing
	Formal Study

1. **Prior to testing: Recruitment**

	* The first thing we need to do is to recruit participates, using our standardized email template and tracking sheet (or you can get them immediately by clicking the checklist link). 

	* After subject accepts the invitation, you will need to assign a specific number to them. Be sure to protect participant's privacy by locking all the documents with password.


2. **Prior to testing: Get Ready with the Test Program**

	* For click task, prepared the interactive prototype in Axure.

	* For the **5 seconds task**, you will need to put your prototype screenshot into the test program which is the PowerPoint named by the task name. 

	![PPT Example](ppt.png)

	* For the **preference task**

	![PPT Example](ppt5.png)

	* For **card sorting task**, you will need to prepare your information into stickers. 

	Tips from [Usability.gov](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/card-sorting.html)
		
	>Prepare the cards 
	Create your list of content topics. Topics can be phrases or words, very specific or more general. As a suggestion, limit yourself to 50-60 topics or less. This means there might not be a card to sort for every page on the site.
			For a new site, list the content topics of types of information that you are likely to have on the site
			For an existing site, list the most important / popular types of content
			To create this list:
			Review the content listed in your content inventory.
			Identify the most important or most frequently used content
	Remote Preference Task, put into the sticks.io

3. **Prior to Each Participant** 

	* Stakeholders and Observers sit on the proper place

	* Before you go to UX room, make sure you have prepared the 'do not disturb' flyer, consent form, script, scenario, prototype, and the note sheet. If you need to count the time, bring the timer.
	
	In the UX room, please assemble the laptop, paper and pen in the location presented in the picture below and hang the 'Do not disturb' flyer on the door.

	![Location Example](location.png)

	* Prepare the recording software and screen cast software if we need to collaborate with Poole team. 

	* Here is the detailed instructions for the software setup.

4. **Prior to Each Task**

	* Welcome participants with preliminary questions. 
	* Ask participant's permission to sign the consent form and record the video. 
	* Read the standard script for the test (**Attention: Each task script, is different it might be confusing that the first and second paragraphs are the same**). The script documents how to perform the task, it might be better to read it first before the test.
	* Participants will need to read the scenario and task before they start. 

	>Tips: Do check with HR and legal departments to make sure there are no regulations or requirements about the data you can collect; Do use age ranges rather than specific ages when asking participants for their age; Do include comment fields for questions where you want to hear more from participants; Don't collect gender information; if you wanto to collect gender note that information separately based on observation.

5. **During the Test**

	* Show the interactive prototype to the participants to allow user to explore for the click test. Click the the five second and preference test PowerPoint presentation mode to run the test automatically.

	* During the test, note taker and moderator should write down the things key to be aware of.

	* When the participants have completed the task or you feel the conversation is over (you are encouraged to gain more information from users if they are willing to stay longer), you should ask them to rate this process and give us some feedback.

6. **After Each Participant**

	* Save all the subject's data to the folder and protect it with passwords. 

	![Test Location Example](filelocation.png)


7. **Pilot Phase: Pilot Test + Formal Test**

	After you have prepared all the documents needed in the test, 

	* Begin with a Run-through. Run through your test yourself or with someone else to make sure that tasks make sense and can be completed with the version of the product you are testing; 

	* Conduct a pilot test with a participant - this participant can be a co-worker or someone you have access to that would be part of the target audience

	* Allow enought time before the test session to make changes.

###Step 3 **Test Report**

After conducting the usability test, you will need to [analyze the qualitative data](qualitative-analysis.md) you get from the test.

We have already made a report template (Keynotes) for you.

![Test Report Screenshots](report.png)

Deliverables: reports, presentations, highlight videos and so on -- document what was done for future reference. They often detail the usability problems found during the test plus any other data such as time on task, error rate, satisfaction, etc. The Usability Test Report on the Morae Resource CD is one template you might use to report results. Generally speaking, report or presentations will include:

* **Summary**

* **Description of the product and the test objectives**

* **Method**

 * Participants

 * Context of the test

 * Tasks

 * Testing environment and equipment

 * Experiment design

* **What was measured (Metrics)**

* **Results and findings**

 * How participants fared (Graphs and tables)
 
 * Why they might not have done well (or why they did do well)
